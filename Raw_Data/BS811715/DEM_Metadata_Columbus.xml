      <abstract>Product: 1-foot bare-earth raster digital elevation model (DEM) data tiles in GeoTIFF format.
      	Geographic Extent: Approximately 755 square miles of QL0 lidar data across the City of Columbus, Ohio, the full coverage of Franklin County, and partial coverage of Delaware, Fairfield, Licking, Madison, Marion, Pickaway, and Union Counties, Ohio.
      	Dataset Description: The OH Columbus 2019 B19 lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and production of derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.29 meters. Project specifications were based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.3. The data was originally developed based on a horizontal datum/projection of NAD83 (HARN) State Plane Ohio South Zone, US Survey Feet, EPSG Code 3754, and a vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B) US Survey Feet. DEM data was delivered as processed GeoTIFF files formatted to 12,138 individual 1,250-foot x 1,250-foot tiles.
      	Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected from March 24, 2019 through April 7, 2019 by Woolpert while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established 132 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 92 checkpoints (55 NVA points and 37 VVA points), were collected and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</abstract>
    	<purpose>This project will support the 3DEP mission, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) high resolution elevation enterprise program and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (MAP) program.</purpose>

    <complete>Datasets contain complete coverage of tiles. No points have been removed or excluded. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness.

    <posacc>
      <vertacc>
      	<vertaccr>The project specifications require the accuracy (ACCz) of the derived DEM be calculated and reported in two ways: 1. The required NVA is: 9.8 cm at a 95% confidence level, derived according to NSSDA, i.e., based on RMSE of 5 cm in non-vegetated land cover classes. This is a required accuracy. The NVA was tested with 55 checkpoints located in non-vegetated areas. 2. Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (VVA): VVA shall be reported for vegetated land cover classes. The target VVA is: 15 cm at the 95th percentile, derived according to ASPRS Guidelines, Vertical Accuracy Reporting for Lidar Data, i.e., based on the 95th percentile error in all vegetated land cover classes combined. This is a target accuracy. The VVA was tested with 37 checkpoints located in vegetated areas. The checkpoints were distributed throughout the project area and were surveyed using GPS techniques. See survey report for additional survey methodologies. AccuracyZ has been tested to meet 19.6 cm or better Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy at 95% confidence level using RMSE(z) x 1.9600 as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASRPS Guidelines.</vertaccr>
